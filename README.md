#JavaScript 30 Tutorials

Objective
	Complete 1-2 of the 30 day tutorials in one day (during the workweek). Projects will be posted on codepen for managers to view our work. Lines of code should be commented so developers understand how the code works. Refer to the github repo link listed below to grab a copy of the html index-START.html and any linked assets you may need (css can be copied/pasted into codepen but youâ€™ll need to link any media/images from github)
